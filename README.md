# Mediflow AI

## 🚀 Project Overview
Mediflow AI is an *AI-powered healthcare solution* designed to optimize *medical oxygen management* and enhance *healthcare worker training* in underserved communities. By integrating *AI-driven predictive analytics, IoT-based patient monitoring, and an AI Trainer Assistant within a Moodle-based Learning Management System (LMS)*, Mediflow AI aims to improve healthcare efficiency and reduce preventable deaths.

## 🏥 Problem Statement
Many healthcare facilities in low-resource settings struggle with *inefficient oxygen supply chains and a lack of trained healthcare professionals*. This results in:
- *Oxygen shortages* leading to preventable deaths, especially among newborns and pneumonia patients.
- *Delayed emergency response* due to poor patient monitoring.
- *Limited access to healthcare training*, especially in rural hospitals.

## 💡 Solution
Mediflow AI integrates *three core components*:
1. *AI-Powered Oxygen Demand Forecasting* – Uses *machine learning and IoT* to predict oxygen shortages in hospitals and optimize supply distribution.
2. *Remote Patient Monitoring System* – Tracks vital signs like oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, providing *real-time alerts* to healthcare providers.
3. *AI Trainer Assistant for Healthcare Workers* – An interactive AI chatbot embedded within *Moodle LMS* for *real-time medical training and decision support*.

## 🛠 Technology Stack
- *Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning* – Predictive analytics for oxygen demand forecasting.
- *Internet of Things (IoT)* – Sensors and real-time patient monitoring.
- *Cloud Computing (Azure)* – Scalable infrastructure for LMS and AI-powered monitoring.
- *Moodle LMS* – AI-powered healthcare training system.
- *Data Science & Analytics* – Real-time patient monitoring and trend analysis.
- *OpenAI API Integration* – Leveraging OpenAI’s NLP models for advanced chatbot interactions and real-time decision support.
- *(Future) Blockchain* – Potential use for secure data management and healthcare training certification.
